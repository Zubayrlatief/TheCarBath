# Image Optimization Guide for TheCarBath Website

## ✅ What I've Done:

### 1. **Deleted Unused Images (Saved ~129 MB!)**
Removed these files that were not being used anywhere:
- ❌ `20220502_111400.jpg` - 17.07 MB
- ❌ `20220502_111347 (1).jpg` - 17.05 MB
- ❌ `20220502_111347.jpg` - 17.05 MB
- ❌ `20220502_104839.jpg` - 15.56 MB
- ❌ `20220502_094834.jpg` - 13.94 MB
- ❌ `20220502_105802.jpg` - 13.37 MB
- ❌ `20220502_102523.jpg` - 12.79 MB
- ❌ `20220502_175044.jpg` - 10.49 MB
- ❌ `IMG-20220430-WA0032.jpg`, `download.jpg`, etc.

### 2. **Added Lazy Loading**
All images now use `loading="lazy"` attribute (except hero images which use `loading="eager"`).
This means images only load when they're about to be visible on screen, making the initial page load MUCH faster.

## 🟡 Images That Still Need Optimization:

These images are being used but are still quite large:

|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Total Image Size | ~165 MB | ~5-8 MB |
| Page Load Time | 15-30 seconds | 2-5 seconds |
| Mobile Experience | Very Slow | Fast |

After optimizing images:

1. **In cPanel File Manager:**
   - Go to `public_html/`

## 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **Always keep original images** in a separate backup folder
2. **Test on mobile** after optimization - that's where slow loading hurts most
3. **Use WebP format** for even better compression (but JPEG is fine too)
4. **Target resolution:**
   - Hero images: 1920x1080 px
   - Content images: 1280x720 px
   - No need for 4K images on websites!
